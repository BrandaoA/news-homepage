# news-homepage
This Project was gotten from frontend mentor and it is ment to taste my skills on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The project comprises of a news letter page with responsive design inorder for it to be displayed both on a phone and on a pc.
For the laptop view, it is just  empty css and html which was intended to taste my skills on how much i have mastered them both.
I used flex boxes to style the images and the text so they appear the way they did.
A little bit of challenge came in with the mobile view as it is ment to display the menu navigation bar when we click on the menu button.
It is also ment to return back to its original view when when click on the close menu button.
This is just a little on my project and i hope it works well.
